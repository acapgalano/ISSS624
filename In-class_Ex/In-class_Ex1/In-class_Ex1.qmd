# Overview

# Getting Started

The code chunk below will install and load `tidyverse` and `sf` packages.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse, spdep)
```

New library: `spdep`

## Importing Geospatial Data

### Importing polygon features

This code chunk will import ESRI shapefile into R.

```{r}
mpsz <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", layer = "MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL")
```

The data is not in latitude/longitude values. SVY21 is for Singapore data. The unit of measurement is in meters.

### Importing and transforming into projected coordinate system

```{r}
preschool = st_read("data/geospatial/pre-schools-location-kml.kml") %>% st_transform(crs = 3414)
```

### Import polygons in shapefile 

```{r}
hunan_sf <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", layer = "Hunan")
```

### Importing attribute data in csv

```{r}

hunan <- read_csv('data/aspatial/Hunan_2012.csv')
```
